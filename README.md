- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aurelius01827
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming for data science, data analytics, etc.

I finished my undergraduate degree in mathematics in 2018, and have aimlessly drifted as a result. Recently, a friend of mine showed me how to utilize programming and coding.
That was about a year ago, and I have been working hard to try and self-teach. In between work and personal commitments, I will be starting on my Master's in Data Science.
